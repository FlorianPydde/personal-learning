# Pre-Commits for Git

Pre-commits are scripts or actions that run before a commit is made in a Git repository. They allow you to enforce code quality, formatting, and other checks to maintain a clean and consistent codebase.

## Learning Resources

To dive into the world of pre-commits and enhance your knowledge, I recommend exploring the following resources:

1. **[Official Pre-Commit Framework Documentation](https://pre-commit.com/)**: The official documentation provides a comprehensive guide on setting up and configuring pre-commits using the Pre-Commit framework.

2. **[Walkthrough](How to use pre-commit to automatically correct commits and merge requests with GitLab CI - Stack Overflow)**: some useful stuff from stackOverflow.

3. **[VideoTutorial](Video tutorial)**: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psjz6rwzMdk>

## Requirements

1. First install pre-commit: pip install pre-commit
2. Create your .pre-commit-config.yaml
3. run pre-commit install

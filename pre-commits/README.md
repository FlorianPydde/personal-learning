# Pre-Commits for Git

Pre-commits are scripts or actions that run before a commit is made in a Git repository. They allow you to enforce code quality, formatting, and other checks to maintain a clean and consistent codebase.

## Learning Resources

To dive into the world of pre-commits and enhance your knowledge, I recommend exploring the following resources:

1. **[Official Pre-Commit Framework Documentation](https://pre-commit.com/)**: The official documentation provides a comprehensive guide on setting up and configuring pre-commits using the Pre-Commit framework.

2. **[Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psjz6rwzMdkl)**

3. **[Walkthrough](https://stackoverflow.com/collectives/articles/71270196/how-to-use-pre-commit-to-automatically-correct-commits-and-merge-requests-with-g)**: some useful stuff from stackOverflow.

## Requirements

1. First install pre-commit: pip install pre-commit
2. Create your .pre-commit-config.yaml
3. run pre-commit install
